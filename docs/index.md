### About the Project

**GEOLocation-Mapper** is a powerful web application designed to visualize and analyze GPS data with a focus on multi-modal transportation routes. Whether you're tracking daily commutes or analyzing movement patterns, this tool provides an intuitive interface for mapping and understanding location-based data.

#### Key Features:
- **Interactive Map Editor**: Manually add GPS points with timestamps and transportation modes (e.g., car, bicycle, bus, train, or foot).
- **Multi-Modal Route Optimization**: Automatically calculates the fastest routes between points based on the selected transportation mode.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Displays color-coded routes for different transportation modes, making it easy to distinguish between segments.
- **Customizable Defaults**: Set default transportation modes and configure route behavior to match real-world scenarios.
- **Data Export & Analysis**: Save GPS data to a database for further analysis or export it for use in other applications.

#### How It Works:
1. **Add Points**: Use the interactive map editor to place markers and assign timestamps.
2. **Set Transportation Modes**: Define how each segment of the journey was traveled (e.g., by car, bicycle, or public transport).
3. **Generate Routes**: The app calculates the fastest path between points based on the selected transportation mode.
4. **Visualize & Analyze**: View the results on a dynamic map with color-coded routes and detailed tooltips.

#### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Routing Engine**: OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension

#### Why This Project?
GEOLocation-Mapper was born out of the need for a flexible tool to visualize and analyze GPS data. Traditional mapping tools often lack support for multi-modal transportation or require complex setups. This project bridges that gap by providing an open-source.

#### Get Involved:
We welcome contributions! Whether you're a developer, designer, or data enthusiast, there are plenty of ways to get involved:
