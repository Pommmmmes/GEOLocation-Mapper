## The Idea:
I came up with this when I was trying to get a map of the GPS data I was collecting to create a heat map of clusters of people. Think of it like the Snap Map, where you see a heat map of places that have a lot of Snapchat activity. I also want to make it possible to take the visualization further by implementing the time factor. The whole thing should be displayable in an OpenStreet Map.

## Current Goals🔥🚀
- [ ] Be Able to Import Data into a Database
- [ ] Simple Preview of data on OpenStreetmap or similar (Interactive)
- [ ]
